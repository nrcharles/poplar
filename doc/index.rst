Welcome to poplar
=================

poplar is an framework to optimize photovoltaic solar energy systems,
particularly those that integrate storage and demand response resources.

poplar attempts to correlate python objects with real world devices to allow
optimization of solar energy systems with various constraints. The theory is
that implementing a bottom up device model should allow the exploration of
various configurations and policies.


It depends on several external libraries including solpy and caelum.
