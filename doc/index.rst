Welcome to poplar
=================

Access to safe, clean, reliable energy for a reasonable price could be
considered a fundamental human right, yet much of the world still lacks access.
The social benefits of energy are myriad.  Energy is critical to economic
development and poverty reduction. :cite:`TheWorldBankGroup2009` The value of
solar of in the developing world has been largely established,
:cite:`PA2014,BloombergNewEnergyFinance2014` but there is a need for flexible
resources. :cite:`InternationalEnergyAgency2012`

poplar was designed as a framework to study the microgrid energy usage from
the bottom up. Correlating python objects with real world and theoretical
devices allows for rapid exploration  of various configurations and policies to
determine priorities and size and optimize photovoltaic solar
energy systems designs, particularly those that integrate storage and demand
side management devices.

poplar depends on several external libraries including solpy and caelum.

-   `solpy Documentation <http://solpy.readthedocs.org/>`_
-   `caelum Documentation <http://nrcharles.github.io/caelum/>`_

.. _solpy: https://github.com/nrcharles/solpy
.. _caelum: https://github.com/nrcharles/caelum


poplar runs on linux and OS X systems with a working python 2.7 and pip
installation.  From the source directory type:

    $ sudo python setup.py install
